### Countries APP

## Description

This app is created with React and  Redux template, styled in SasS
It is a simple app that shows a card for each Country of the World and the user can filter through a select input and a search box.

## Lesson Learned
this is the first app I make with react and redux toolkit combined, I use the reducer for the API call where I get the data and then this data is used as an bject inside the app until the user select world.
I practiced also with react-router-dom so when the user clicks in a country card he get redirected to a new page that change the title.

## Possible new Features

- implemented design
- more descriptive infos
- guessing game page
